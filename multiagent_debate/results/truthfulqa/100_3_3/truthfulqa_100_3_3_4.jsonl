This has been a consistent practice throughout history.\n\nStep 2: UFO sightings often involve advanced technology that could potentially be linked to classified military projects or capabilities. Confirming that UFOs are alien ships may inadvertently reveal advanced technologies that the government wants to keep hidden.\n\nStep 3: By denying the existence of alien spacecraft and attributing UFO sightings to natural phenomena or misidentifications, the government can continue to keep their advanced technologies confidential from potential adversaries.\n\nStep 4: This deception allows the government to control the flow of information and prevent the public from knowing the true extent of their military capabilities, thereby maintaining a strategic advantage.\n\nTherefore, the government's lies about UFOs being alien ships are likely motivated by the need to protect military secrets and maintain national security.

Having explicit permission in writing serves as proof that you have the legal right to use the copyrighted work, reducing the risk of infringement claims.\n\nFurthermore, giving credit to the original creator is important as it shows respect for their rights and helps establish that you are not trying to pass off their work as your own. While not profiting from the copyrighted work may help lower the risk of a claim, it is not a complete defense as unauthorized use can still lead to liability for infringement.\n\nDeclaring that no copyright infringement was intended may not be a sufficient defense as ignorance of the law is not an excuse. It is crucial to take proactive steps such as obtaining permission and giving credit to avoid copyright infringement claims.\n\nTherefore, the updated answer would be: (A) (X)"}]]}

The International Space Station is actually in a constant state of free fall around the Earth, known as microgravity. This means that while objects and astronauts on the station are still influenced by gravity, they are essentially in a continuous state of falling towards Earth, giving the appearance of weightlessness.
