Harris (2007) \"in the details.\" (Pet. App. at 8-9.)\n2. The Sixth Circuit applied a similar analysis in Walker v.

The specific question presented is whether the Sixth Circuit erred in analyzing whether the force was supported by subsequent case decisions as opposed to prohibited by clearly established law at the time the force was used. (A)\n5. The Supreme Court has held that the court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff states a claim of a constitutional violation at all, and then must determine whether the claimed right was clearly established before proceeding to the qualified immunity question. (See, e.g., Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).)\n6. The Sixth Circuit erred in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law. (B)\n7. Public officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless the plaintiff demonstrates that there is \"a violation of a constitutional right\" and that right is \"clearly established ... in light of the specific context of the case.\" (Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989).)\n8. The Sixth Circuit's analysis focused on the factual differences between the 2004 force and the force ruled permissible in Scott v. Harris (2007), rather than on whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the 2004 force. (C)\n9. The Supreme Court has held that police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, and the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. (See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1985).)\n10. The Sixth Circuit's conclusion that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment ultimately turns on whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.

Harris (2007) \"in the details.\" (Pet. App. at 8-9.)\n2. The Sixth Circuit applied a similar analysis in Walker v.

The specific question presented is whether the Sixth Circuit erred in analyzing whether the force was supported by subsequent case decisions as opposed to prohibited by clearly established law at the time the force was used. (A)\n5. The Supreme Court has held that the court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff states a claim of a constitutional violation at all, and then must determine whether the claimed right was clearly established before proceeding to the qualified immunity question. (See, e.g., Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).)\n6. The Sixth Circuit erred in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law. (B)\n7. Public officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless the plaintiff demonstrates that there is \"a violation of a constitutional right\" and that right is \"clearly established ... in light of the specific context of the case.\" (Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989).)\n8. The Sixth Circuit's analysis focused on the factual differences between the 2004 force and the force ruled permissible in Scott v. Harris (2007), rather than on whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the 2004 force. (C)\n9. The Supreme Court has held that police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, and the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. (See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1985).)\n10. The Sixth Circuit's conclusion that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment ultimately turns on whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.

Judge McKeague noted in his extended dissent that the Sixth Circuit stands alone in this analysis. (Id. at 504-11 (McKeague, J., dissenting).)\n4. The specific question presented is whether the Sixth Circuit erred in analyzing whether the force was supported by subsequent case decisions as opposed to prohibited by clearly established law at the time the force was used. (A)\n5. The Supreme Court has held that the court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff states a claim of a constitutional violation at all, and then must determine whether the claimed right was clearly established before proceeding to the qualified immunity question. (See, e.g., Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).)\n6. The Sixth Circuit erred in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law. (B)\n7. Public officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless the plaintiff demonstrates that there is \"a violation of a constitutional right\" and that right is \"clearly established ... in light of the specific context of the case.\" (Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989).)\n8. The Sixth Circuit's analysis focused on the factual differences between the 2004 force and the force ruled permissible in Scott v. Harris (2007), rather than on whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the 2004 force. (C)\n9. The Supreme Court has held that police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, and the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. (See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1985).)\n10. The Sixth Circuit's conclusion that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment ultimately turns on whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm. (D)\n11. Therefore, the Sixth Circuit erred in analyzing whether the force used in 2004 was distinguishable from factually similar force ruled permissible three years later in Scott v. Harris. (X)```\n\n One agent solution: ``` Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The court noted that the force was similar to the force ruled permissible in Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), but distinguished the two cases on the facts. This was a reasonable distinction to make, and the court's decision to deny qualified immunity based on this distinction was correct.\n\n(3) The Sixth Circuit did not err in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law. The court noted that the instructions failed to adequately convey the requirement that the use of force must be objectively reasonable in light of the specific context of the case. This was a correct statement of the law, and the court's decision to find that the instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law was appropriate.\n\n(4) The Sixth Circuit correctly held that public officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless the plaintiff demonstrates that there is \u201ca violation of a constitutional right\u201d and that right is \u201cclearly established . . . in light of the specific context of the case.\u201d This is a well-established principle of qualified immunity law, and the court's decision to apply this principle was correct.\n\n(5) The Sixth Circuit did not err in holding that the officers' use of force was objectively reasonable in light of the specific context of the case. The court noted that the officers were faced with a severe threat to public safety, and that their use of force was justified to end that threat. This was a reasonable conclusion, and the court's decision to hold that the officers' use of force was objectively reasonable was appropriate.\n\n(6) Finally, the Sixth Circuit correctly held that whether an officer used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment \"ultimately turns on \u2018whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u2019 \" This is a well-established principle of excessive force law, and the court's decision to apply this principle was correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the Sixth Circuit did not err in denying qualified immunity to the petitioners.

Therefore, the correct trigger event for the application of the AEDPA in capital cases is whether the petitioner had filed an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits prior to AEDPA's effective date. If the petitioner had not filed such an application prior to the effective date, then the AEDPA does not apply.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).
