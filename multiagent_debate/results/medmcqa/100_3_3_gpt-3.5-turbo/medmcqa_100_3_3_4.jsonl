Ephedrine, as a mixed alpha and beta agonist, has the potential to increase heart rate and cardiac output, which can lead to adverse effects such as tachycardia and arrhythmias in pregnancy.\n\n2. Both Methoxamine and Mephentermine are not commonly used vasopressors in pregnancy due to concerns about their effects on uterine vasoconstriction and placental blood flow, which may harm the fetus.\n\n3. Phenylephrine, being a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, primarily acts as a vasoconstrictor without significant impact on the uterus or placental blood flow. This makes it the safest option in maintaining blood pressure without compromising the well-being of both the mother and the fetus during pregnancy.\n\nTherefore, considering the preference for vasopressors with minimal adverse effects and maximum safety for both the mother and the fetus, the vasopressor of choice in pregnancy is Phenylephrine.\n\nX(B) Phenylephrine."}]]}

Occlusion refers to the way that the upper and lower teeth come together when the mouth is closed. It is crucial to have proper occlusion in order to create stability and balance in the mouth, which in turn leads to better prosthetic prognosis.\n\nHaving proper occlusion helps in distributing the forces evenly across the teeth, preventing excessive pressure on certain areas that can lead to discomfort or damage to the prosthetic.
