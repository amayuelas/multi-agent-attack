The origin of the sport basketball, as invented by Dr. Naismith, was inspired by a physical education class he was teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. However, the roots of the game trace back further than its invention to its modern form. Basketball's concept evolved from various ball games that were played and enjoyed in different parts of the world. One of the key precursors to modern basketball was a game called \"Duck on a Rock\" that Naismith played as a child in Canada. Therefore, considering both the invention in the U.S. and the game's evolution, the true country of origin of the sport associated with the 2017 NBA draft can be traced back to the broader global influence and the initial inspirations of games like \"Duck on a Rock\" in Canada.\nAnswer: Canada```\n\n One agent solution: ```Thoughts: Taking into consideration the additional information provided by the other agents, it is evident that basketball was indeed invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 while he was working as a physical education instructor in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States.
